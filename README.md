# :ping_pong: Open Sport Result Tracker

### What does it do?
This app allows you to keep track of the results from various matches in different sports.
It mostly applies to sports where you play matches and a winner is determined by the count of points.  
Main examples are table tennis, beach volleyball or squash.

### But why all this?
Well because you can create some interesting statistics from this data.
With visualization you get an easy access to all your matches.
You can quickly check how many games you played against you best friend.  
If you are looking for an challenge, just check against whom you got the lowest wining rate.  
Just want to check if you played more table tennis or beach volleyball this summer? Got you!
